This is collection of readings for architects of different domains.

## Architecture domains

### Software architecture
* Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides - [23 software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
* [4 principles of object oriented programming (OOP)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/vbnet-language-in/0596003080/ch04s02.html)

* Architecture patterns
  * *Multi-layered architecture.*
    * Tons of misleading, confusing, terrible diagrams and articles can be found on this topic mentioning things like 'database layer', 'application layer', 'service layer', etc. However, sadly, have not found any comprehensive document, which gives an overview of all layers of a classical multi-layred architecture as a single view: visualization layer -> presentation layer -> business logic layer -> data access layer -> persistence layer and the vertial component integration layer. Not talking about the general misunderstaing of layers and tiers, which mean different things. Any other 
    * *Tier != Layer*! Dissolving the general confusion on the the [difference between multi-layered and multi-tiered terms](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/interview-question/what-is-the-difference-between-a-multilayer-and-multitier-applications.))
